# Personal Portfolio Site

Currently working to create my own Portfolio Site using React and SCSS.

## Under Construction

At present the site is under construction. There are several place holders ready for my Projects and Works to be added. Along with the technical aspects of React and SCSS I am also using this as an example of working on projects and adding commits over time, rather than pushing everything to my GitHub at the end of the project as I have done before. I am looking for this to help with Version Control which will serve me well into the world of work.
